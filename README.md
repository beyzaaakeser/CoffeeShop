<h1>Coffee Shop Website</h1>

The meeting point for delicious coffee and a pleasant atmosphere is Coffee Muse! A responsive design and modern coffee shop website that I prepared with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, ScrollReveal, Swiper, and Box Icons, offering a perfect experience for coffee lovers. It provides an interactive and dynamic user experience using popular JavaScript libraries such as ScrollReveal and Swiper. Up-to-date information, such as menus and prices, is easily accessible. It allows online ordering or reservations.
